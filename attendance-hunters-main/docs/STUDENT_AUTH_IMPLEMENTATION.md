# Student Authentication Implementation

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Update
- Added `password` field to Student model in Prisma schema
- Created and applied migration `20250913062027_add_student_password`
- Updated all 31 students with bcrypt hashed password "student123"

### 2. Backend API Implementation
- Created `/api/student-auth/login` endpoint for student authentication
- Created `/api/student-auth/profile` endpoint for student profile
- Implemented JWT token generation and validation
- Added bcrypt password hashing and verification
- Updated server.js to include student-auth routes

### 3. Frontend Integration
- Updated `useAuth` hook to support real API authentication for students
- Modified login page to show actual student emails for demo
- Updated Header component to display real student information
- Modified StudentDashboard to use real student data from localStorage
- Updated QR code processing to use authenticated student data

### 4. Password Management
- All students can now login with password: `student123`
- Passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt
- Sample working credentials:
  - alice.johnson@university.edu / student123
  - bob.smith@university.edu / student123
  - carol.davis@university.edu / student123
  - (and 28 more students)

## ðŸš€ Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `server/api/routes/student-auth.js` - Student authentication API
2. `server/api/update-student-passwords.js` - Password update script
3. `server/api/test-student-login.js` - API testing script

### Modified Files:
1. `server/api/config/db/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added password field
2. `server/api/src/services/server.js` - Added student-auth route
3. `server/web/src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Real API integration
4. `server/web/src/pages/auth/LoginPage.tsx` - Updated demo credentials
5. `server/web/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Real user data display
6. `server/web/src/pages/student/StudentDashboard.tsx` - Real student data

## ðŸ“Š Database Status
- **Total Students**: 31
- **All students have password**: "student123" (bcrypt hashed)
- **Authentication ready**: âœ…
- **JWT tokens**: Working with 24h expiration

## ðŸ”§ API Endpoints

### Student Authentication
```
POST /api/student-auth/login
Body: { "email": "student@university.edu", "password": "student123" }
Response: { "success": true, "token": "jwt_token", "student": {...} }

GET /api/student-auth/profile
Headers: { "Authorization": "Bearer jwt_token" }
Response: { "student": {...} }
```

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### Login Flow:
1. Student enters email and password on login page
2. Frontend calls `/api/student-auth/login` with credentials
3. Backend validates password using bcrypt
4. JWT token generated and returned with student data
5. Token and student info stored in localStorage
6. User redirected to student dashboard

### Dashboard Flow:
1. Student data loaded from localStorage
2. Header displays real student name and email
3. QR code scanning uses authenticated student ID
4. All student-specific features use real data

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### Working Login Credentials:
```
Email: alice.johnson@university.edu
Password: student123

Email: bob.smith@university.edu  
Password: student123

Email: carol.davis@university.edu
Password: student123

Email: diana.foster@university.edu
Password: student123

Email: maya.singh@university.edu
Password: student123

... and 26 more students
```

### Test Commands:
```bash
# Test API locally
node test-student-login.js

# Verify database
node verify-database-data.js

# Update passwords if needed
node update-student-passwords.js
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment Requirements

### For Production Server:
1. Deploy updated API code with student-auth routes
2. Apply database migration for password field
3. Run password update script on production database
4. Deploy updated frontend with real authentication

### Environment Variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret

## âœ… Ready for Use

The student authentication system is fully implemented and ready for production deployment. All 31 students in the database can now login using their email addresses with the password "student123". The system provides:

- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token-based authentication
- Real student data in dashboard and header
- Proper session management
- API endpoints for login and profile

Once deployed to production, students will be able to:
1. Login with their university email and password
2. See their real information in the dashboard
3. Use QR code attendance marking with their authenticated identity
4. Access all student features with proper authentication
